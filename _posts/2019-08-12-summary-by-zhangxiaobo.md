### The summer vacation is drawing to a close, look back the activities we joined, I must to say, Huangpu Scout was a very well-prepared summer camp with the support from selfless,  passionate and versatile parents who want to provide great value to the kids, I was impressed by the comprehensive plan and execution with the leadership from WY![imageWY], there was tremendous effort invested from the core team.  My family feels so fortunate to meet you all in the team.
### The daily schedule ![image460] was very packed with physical, philosophy, technical and outdoor in the curriculum.
### The camp was inaugurated with the topic of “Gratitude in Mind”, it was inspiring for the kids to understand the fundamental philosophy, how to appreciate others.
### ![image3]We all want to break through the personal limit, however, seldom put into execution. Obstacle course is a great tool to escalate the kid’s capability.  It was a great day with nice weather, while the brutal sun was hindering the courage.  Beyond expectation, none of them complained the situation, they all bravely faced all challenges during the competition, fortunately we had a professional MC as “cheer leader” to boost the morale. 
### The unforgettable water part adventure![image4] was imprinted in their mind. Rafting and Aquatic challenge were the most exciting activities, the kids were screaming with excitement, especially racing through the inflatable water playground, moving across the slippery, wobble obstacle was a bittersweet experience.  After this exhausted day, parents were gratified to see they gobbled the food ceaselessly.
### Thanks to those conscientious parents as guards dedicated to ensuring the safety, it was a tiring responsibility. 
### Dangling from the rope![image5] was another testament for their braveness, most of kids had not had this experience, even the minor step became a triumph, gradually they established the confidence, convinced themselves and trust the belay. 
### No doubt we need to set aside some time for homework, I also noticed a few kids have great and consistent habits which ensure the long-term success.
### There was one guy(ZGG) had demonstrated the perseverance in front of the Scouts for building the Bamboo Villa![imageBamboo], he is a tough guy who is usually lead the 50km and 100km trekking, he also took the lead of teaching cord knotting class.  Starting from the very first day, he had been working on constructing the big gift by knotting the junctions for days under the relentless sun.
### (There were so many wonderful activities not included in this article, like pull up the peanut plants, field paintball battle, dashing on the mud, fish catching, making dumplings, mind-map, giving a speech, specimen making, mathematics, how the brain works etc…… I am working on it and hope to get your contribution as well)
### The hardship did not wear their volition, on the contrary, it unearthed the respective potential and they will become fearless, more mature all-rounder Scout.
